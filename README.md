# cmpe250-projects

Five Java projects assigned for the Data Structures and Algorithms (CMPE 250) course in the Fall 2021-22 semester. These projects apply DS&A concepts such as discrete-event simulation (DES) using priority queues, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST), Dinic's algorithm for maximum flow problems, and weighted job scheduling with dynamic programming to real-world problems.
